# Long-Range-Fit

## Description

Gas phase molecular dynamics is an active area of research due to its relevance in many fields of study, such as atmospheric chemistry, environmental chemistry, and astrochemistry, with a vast range of applications. For instance, studies of important molecules in our atmosphere, such as ozone (responsible for protecting us from solar radiation) or carbon monoxide (one of the vital trace gases used in the study of air quality and climate forcing), and many others, are essential for understanding phenomena like global warming, pollution, or acid rain formation. These molecular systems are found in environments where the system population is away from thermal equilibrium. Therefore, interpreting the observations requires simulating the molecular interactions with an accurate Potential Energy Surface (PES). For many applications, the long-range region of a PES (dominated by electrostatic, induction, and dispersion) is crucial; however, although its theoretical description is a well-studied subject, implementing its mathematical formulation can be highly challenging.
LRF is a python package was designed to assist in fitting the long-range region of a PES for systems composed of (any) two rigid molecules.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Test
## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
